1. given a linked list that contains only 0s and 1s. convert it from binary to decimal.
eg : 
head: 1->0->1->1 
number is 11

4) follow-up: do the above question in single pass/iteration

2. given two arrays A and B. sort A according to array B.
ex-1:
A = [4, 8, 6, 5, 1, 2, 4, 4, 7, 3, 8]
B = [4, 7, 1]
output is [4, 4, 4, 7, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 8]

ex-2:
A = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]
B = [5, 1, 2]
output is [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]

Explanation: first the elements given in B must come in same order as in B and then remaining elements should 
come in sorted order.

Favorite Candy
Your friend has N different kind of candies each present in Mi units (i = 1 to N). He is allowed to eat only one type of candy every day. Since he likes some candies more than the others, he gives each type of candy a priority and eats the higher priority candies first. However, there is a limit to it that he cannot eat more than k candies in one day (i.e. he may eat 1 or 2, â€¦ or k candies in a day. He asks you if somehow, he would be able to eat Xth type of candy on the Yth day.
Note: He can only eat candy with priority p, after eating all the candies of priority p+1

[5, 2, 6, 4, 1] -> Candy count
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] -> Priority
X Y Result
5 1 -> YES
4 4 -> YES
3 16 -> NO
1 16 -> YES
2 8 -> YES
