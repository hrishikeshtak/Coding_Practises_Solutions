1. given a linked list that contains only 0s and 1s. convert it from binary to decimal.
eg : 
head: 1->0->1->1 
number is 11

4) follow-up: do the above question in single pass/iteration

2. given two arrays A and B. sort A according to array B.
ex-1:
A = [4, 8, 6, 5, 1, 2, 4, 4, 7, 3, 8]
B = [4, 7, 1]
output is [4, 4, 4, 7, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 8]

ex-2:
A = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]
B = [5, 1, 2]
output is [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]

Explanation: first the elements given in B must come in same order as in B and then remaining elements should 
come in sorted order.
