# collections.namedtuple()

# Basically, namedtuples are easy to create, lightweight object types.
# They turn tuples into convenient containers for simple tasks.
# With namedtuples, you donâ€™t have to use integer indices for
# accessing members of a tuple.

# Task

# Dr. John Wesley has a spreadsheet containing a list of student's ID's,
# marks, class and name.

# Your task is to help Dr. Wesley calculate the average marks of the students.

# Input Format

# The first line contains an integer N, the total number of students.
# The second line contains the names of the columns in any order.
# The next N lines contains the marks, IDs, name and class, under
# their respective column names.

# Output Format

# Print the average marks of the list corrected to 2 decimal places.

# Sample Input

# TESTCASE 01

# 5
